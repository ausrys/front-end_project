## About this project

This project is a landing page that showcases projects that have been completed. It is built with Laravel, a PHP web application framework, and uses MySQL as the database.In this project I mainly focused on replicating front-end from a given Figma example. For convenience back-end was added using Laravel framework. Simple tasks that back-end was providing:

- Get projects from database and dynamically load them on the screen.
- API's created to add new projects to database.
- Added mail service.
